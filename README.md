## Research Context

This simulation is based on the HYDROBOT research project addressing flood rescue challenges in the Philippines:

### Problem Statement

-   Climate change has intensified flooding in the Philippines
-   Traditional rescue methods struggle in murky, debris-filled water
-   Zero visibility conditions make manual searches extremely difficult
-   Rescuers often don't know where to look for victims

### Solution Approach

-   Thermal imaging sensors can detect heat signatures through water
-   Submersible design allows operation in various water conditions
-   Autonomous search patterns maximize search efficiency
-   Real-time data transmission guides rescue operations

### Key Innovation

The HYDROBOT uses specially designed thermal sensors placed above the waterline but facing downward, allowing detection of heat signatures even in turbid water conditions.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start Development Server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Open Browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`

4. **Start Simulation**:
    - Choose operation mode (Auto/Manual/Rescue/Deep-Search)
    - Select search pattern
    - Adjust environment parameters
    - Watch the HYDROBOT locate victims!

## Simulation Tips

1. **Start with First-Person**: Get immersed in the rescue experience right away
2. **Switch to Third-Person**: When you need better navigation and spatial awareness
3. **Use Surface Sweep**: Good for initial reconnaissance in auto mode
4. **Manual Collection**: Drive close to victims (within 2m) to automatically rescue them
5. **Use Rescue Mode**: When you need to prioritize human survivors in auto mode
6. **Monitor Battery**: Emergency surface when battery is low
7. **Adjust Turbidity**: Higher turbidity reduces thermal detection range
8. **Watch for Debris**: Robot will automatically avoid obstacles
9. **Check Heat Signatures**: Different colors indicate different types of victims
10. **Cycle Camera Views**: Use different views for different situations (first-person for collection, overview for strategy)
